## Emotion Detection:
Given a video as input we will be able to detect emotions.<br>
We are using a pre-trained model to predict the emotions. <br><br>

Once the emotions are detected, we assign values to each emotion to plot a graph of emotion vs frame. This graph will be helpful for furthur analysis to understand the nature of video.
